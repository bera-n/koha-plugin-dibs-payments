# Introduction
This Koha plugin enables a library to accept online payments from patrons using the DIBS payments platform.
See https://tech.dibspayment.com/D2

# Installing
This plugin needs the following perl modules:
* Locale::Currency::Format (liblocale-currency-format-perl)
* Digest::MD5 (libdigest-md5-perl)

To set up the Koha plugin system you must first make some changes to your install.

* Change `<enable_plugins>0<enable_plugins>` to `<enable_plugins>1</enable_plugins>` in your koha-conf.xml file
* Confirm that the path to `<pluginsdir>` exists, is correct, and is writable by the web server
* Add the pluginsdir to your apache PERL5LIB paths and koha-plack startup scripts PERL5LIB
* Restart your webserver

Once set up is complete you will need to alter your UseKohaPlugins system preference. On the Tools page you will see the Tools Plugins and on the Reports page you will see the Reports Plugins.
